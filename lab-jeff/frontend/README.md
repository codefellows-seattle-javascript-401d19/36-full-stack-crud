# Codefellows javascript 401 lab 31 - REACT Redux - Categories

## Purpose

Learn to use React with Redux by creating an API which allows a user to create an expense category with a name and budget. Within an expense category, the user can create expense items.  All the items are displayed in a list. Each item has a button that allows the user to delete it.  Doubleclicking an item allows the user to edit it.

## To use

Install dependencies:
`npm install`
Run webpack dev server:
`npm run watch`
Open your browser at localhost:8080.

Type a name for your category into the name box. Enter a budget for your item into the $0.00 box. Click Create Category.

Within the expense, type a name for an individual expense.  Enter the amount of the expense.  Click Create Expense.

Each item will be added to a list below the entry form.   Click the delete button to delete an item.  Doubleclick an item to edit it.

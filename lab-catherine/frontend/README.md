## Lab 36: Budget Tracker

### Author: 
Catherine Looper

### Motivation

In this project, I built a frontend Continent/Forest Tracker application. To create a new continent item, users can enter a continent name and a population and click `create continent`. Users can update a continent item by double-clicking on the continent that they would like to update. Users also have the ability to remove any of their created continent items by clicking the `X` button next to the continent item they would like to remove. 

Users can also add forests to each continent by entering a forest `name` and `location` and clicking the `create forest` button. Users can edit information by double-clicking on the forest they want to update, and can click `X` to remove the forest from the continent.

In this application, I configured webpack to compile JavaScript and SASS into a bundle and configured babel to transpile JSX and ES6 to ES5 JavaScript. I was able to create and render React components to the DOM, add event listeners to React components, and update React component state.

This lab is using MongoDB for persistence.

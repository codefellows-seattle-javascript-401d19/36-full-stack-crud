##  Lab 13 && 14 Express and Mongo two resource RESTful API

### Author:
 Catherine Looper

### Motivation

In this project, I built a RESTful (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) HTTP server using Express. This server handles GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests/responses. This API uses MongoDB and Mongoose to write data to a db directory for persistence. The database is based on a "one-to-many" relationship where there are many forests and each forest has only one corresponding continent.

### Build

#### Server Module

The server module is creating an http server, defining server-on behavior and exporting an interface for starting and stopping the server. The server module exports an object containing start and stop methods.

The server module requires in express, mongoose, logger, logger-middleware, continent-router and the forest-router.js file. The server.start and stop methods return a new Promise with resolve and reject parameters. The start method contains an app.listen function that listens for the server start. The server.stop method has an httpServer.close function that turns the server off by setting the isServerOn variable to false.

#### Route Module

##### `forest-router.js`

forest-router.js requires in the Router object from express, the jsonParser, http-errors, the logger module  and forest.js. Inside the module, there are functions declared for forestRouter.post, forestRouter.get, forestRouter.delete, and forestRouter.put. These methods each handle their corresponding method and send the appropriate response based on the input. The forestRouter is exporting a new Router instance. Additionally, I set up a get all forests route with pagination that returns an array of forests. This app has been refactored to reflect a one to many relationship where forests are many and continents are one.

##### `continent-router.js` 

continent-router.js requires in the Router object from express, the jsonParser, http-errors, and continent.js. Inside the module, there are functions declared for continentRouter.post, continentRouter.get, continentRouter.delete, and continentRouter.put. These methods each handle their corresponding method and send the appropriate response based on the input. The continentRouter is exporting a new Router instance. The continent router represents the one in the 'one to many' relationship.

#### Model Module

The model module contains a `forest.js` file that requires in mongoose and has a forestSchema with the properties: name, location, type, description, and timestamp. The mongoose.model is being exported from this file. The model module also contains a `continent.js` file that requires in mongoose and has a continentSchema with the properties: name, size, population, keywords, and forests.
#### Test Module

Contains a `lib/` directory with the files: `setup.js`, `continent-mock.js` and `forest-mock.js`. These files assist in the tests by setting up the environment variables and mock objects to test.

continent-router.test.js and forest-router.test.js contain tests for `POST`, `GET`, `DELETE` and `PUT` methods.

* `POST` - tests for status codes: 
  * `200` - successful post request
  * `400` - if an incomplete post request is sent
  * `409` - if keys are unique
* `GET` - tests for status codes: 
  * `200` - successful get request 
  * `404` - if id is invalid
* `DELETE` - tests for status codes: 
  * `204` - successful delete request
  * `404` - if id is invalid
  * `400` - if an incomplete delete request is sent
* `PUT` - tests for status codes: 
  * `200` - successful update request
  * `400` - if an incomplete put request is sent
  * `404` - if id is invalid 
  * `409` - if keys are unique

*** Additionally - I created and tested a GET route with pagination for returning an array of forests ***

#### Middleware

##### `error-middleware.js`

The error-middleware module handles error messages for a variety of different use cases, including HTTP errors and MONGODB errors. 

* HTTP errors include the following logs: 

 ``` 
  logger.log('info','__ERROR_MIDDLEWARE__');
  logger.log('info',error);

  if(error.status){
    logger.log('info',Responding with a ${error.status} status and message: ${error.message});
    return response.sendStatus(error.status);
  }
  ```
* MONGODB errors include the following logs:

```
  if(message.includes('validation failed')) {
    logger.log('info','Responding with a 400 status code');
    return response.sendStatus(400);
  }

  if(message.includes('duplicate key')) {
    logger.log('info','Responding with a 409 status code');
    return response.sendStatus(409);
  }

  if(message.includes('objectid failed')) {
    logger.log('info','Responding with a 404 status code');
    return response.sendStatus(404);
  }

  if(message.includes('unauthorized')) {
    logger.log('info','Responding with a 401 status code');
    return response.sendStatus(401);
  }
```

* If there is an error that doesn't match the above, then:

```
  logger.log('info', 'Responding with a 500 status code');
  logger.log('info', error);
  return response.sendStatus(500);
```

##### `logger-middleware.js`

The logger-middleware module logs the request method processes and request urls and returns next to continue on in the promise chain.

### Limitations

To use this app - it is assumed that the user has familiarity with the tech and frameworks listed below. 

### Code Style

Standard JavaScript with ES6

### Tech/Framework used

* JavaScript / ES6
* Node.js
* Jest
* Eslint
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Winston
* Express
* Superagent
* Dotenv
* Body-Parser
* Faker
* http-errors

### How to use?

* Step 1. Fork and Clone the Repository.
* Step 2. `npm install`.
* Step 3. touch a `.env` file and add the following to the file: `PORT=3000` and `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/testing`.
* Step 4. start MongoDB by calling `npm run dbon`.
* Step 5. to test the API, open a second terminal window and run the command `npm run test`.
* Step 6. If you would like to start the server, you can run the command `npm run start`.

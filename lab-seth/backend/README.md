# Mongo Double Resource

This is a simple HTTP server which follows REST constraints, that allows users to input a url to GET, PUT, or DELETE a expense and a category from a Mongo Database! It contains tests to make sure that the RESTful operations worked properly.

## Routes Explanation

### URL: /api/expense?id={**_id_**}  & /api/category?id={**_id_**}

#### GET: 
  - If a valid **id** is given:
    - Server response: _object with that Item's properties as key:value pairs from the database and a 200 status code_
  - If **_NO id or an incorrect id_** is given:
    - Server response: 404 Error saying expense is not found.
#### POST: 
  - If valid **information** is given:
    - Server response: _stores the new Item in the database and sends a 200 status code_
  - If the **_id is incorrect, was not given, or the data given does not have the required types and minimum level_**:
    - Server response: _400 error_ stating that body and content are rquired.
#### PUT: 
  - If a valid **id** is given:
    - Server response: _stores the updated Item info in the database and sends a 200 status code_
  - If the **_id is incorrect, was not given, or the data given does not have the required types_**:
    - Server response: _400 error_ stating that body and content are rquired.
#### DELETE: 
  - If a valid **id** is given:
    - Server response: _deletes the expense from the database and sends a 204 status_
  - If the **_id is incorrect or was not given_**:
    - Server response: _404 error_ Item Not Found

## Code Example

### Routes Example
```
expenseRouter.post('/api/expenses', jsonParser, (request,response, next) => {  
  if(!request.body.name || !request.body.content) {
    return next(httpErrors(400, 'body and content are required'));
  }

  return new Expense(request.body).save()
    .then(expense => response.json(expense)) //this sends a 200
    .catch(next);
});

expenseRouter.get('/api/expenses/:id', (request,response,next) => {
  return Expense.findById(request.params.id)
    .then(expense => {
      if(!expense){
        throw httpErrors(404, 'Expense not found');
      }
      logger.log('info', 'GET - Returning a 200 status code');
      return response.json(expense);
    }).catch(next);
});


categoryRouter.delete('/api/categorys/:id', (request, response, next) => {
  return category.findByIdAndRemove(request.params.id)
    .then(category => {
      if (!category) {
        throw httpErrors(404, 'category not found');
      }
      logger.log('info', 'GET - Returning a 204 status code');
      return response.sendStatus(204);
    }).catch(next);
});

categoryRouter.put('/api/categorys/:id', jsonParser, (request, response, next) => {
  let options = { runValidators: true, new: true };
  if (!request.body.name || !request.body.budget) {
    return next(httpErrors(400, 'Body and Name are required'));
  }

  return category.findByIdAndUpdate(request.params.id, request.body, options)
    .then(category => {
      if (!category) {
        throw httpErrors(404, 'category not found');
      }
      logger.log('info', 'GET - Returning a 200 status code');
      return response.json(category);
    }).catch(next);
});

## Tests

- Confirms a 200 status code on a proper POST request
- Confirms a 400 status code when an improper POST request is made

- Confirms a 200 status code on a proper GET request
- Confirms a 400 status code when an improper GET request is made

- Confirms a 200 status code on a proper PUT request
- Confirms a 400 status code when an improper PUT request is made

- Confirms a 200 status code on a proper DELETE request
- Confirms a 400 status code when an improper DELETE request is made

#### To Run Tests, run these commands in terminal from lab-seth folder

- npm run dbon
- npm run test
  - this will populate the database with five examples first then run tests on on the routes
